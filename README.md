# sounddevice
Setup a docker file that will install Python's sounddevice on a Raspberry Pi using Balena (formerly Resin.io)
After software installation, a python script is executed.  This script plays a wav file through an audio output device.

This is not yet working -- something goes wrong at the cd portaudio and then ./configure steps
